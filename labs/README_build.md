# Build Scripts

- `build_init`: creates build directory and enters it
- `build_release`: produces release build, validates and benchmarks it
- `build_debug`: produces debug build, validates and benchmarks it, then records perf data (use `perf report` to then view the collected data)

Use `source` to run these from the assignment directory.
